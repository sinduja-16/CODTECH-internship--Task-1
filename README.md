## Overview of the Project
### Project: Simple Calculator Program in python

### Objective 
  The objective of this project is to develop a Python program that functions as a basic calculator, allowing users to input two numbers, select an operation, and then display the calculated result based on the chosen operation
  
### Key Activities

1. **Define Mathematical Functions:** Implement functions for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
2. **User Input Handling:** Prompt the user to select an operation and input two numbers for calculation.
3. **Conditional Logic:** Apply conditional statements to execute the selected operation based on the user's choice.
4. **Display Results:** Output the result of the calculation in a user-friendly format.
5. **Error Handling:** Include basic validation to manage invalid inputs or operations.

### Technologies Used 

1. **Python Programming Language:** The core technology used to implement the calculator's functionality, including defining functions, handling user input, and applying conditional logic.
2. **Python Built-in Functions:** Functions like `input()` for capturing user input and `print()` for displaying outputs.
3. **Control Structures:** Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) are used to manage the flow of the program based on user choices.
4. **Mathematical Operations:** Basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) are used within the defined functions to perform calculations.
